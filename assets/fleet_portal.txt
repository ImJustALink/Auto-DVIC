DVIC submission flow:
    - User clicks "Begin Inspection Submission" button. Extension opens and fills DVIC pdf in the background and saves the filled file. Popup then closes.
    - Extension selects/clicks the "Upload inspection" button on vehicle page to begin inspection upload and information provision to the Amazon Fleet portal. "Upload inspection" button is the same button we target to add the extensions's "Auto DVIC" button.
    - Extension waits for new page to load and then searches for the div with the class "css-1b9zydf" or looks for the "Select file to upload" link/button and clicks it. If possible it auto selects the pdf file we generated, otherwise waits for the user to select the pdf file.
    - By default the page has the radio button for "Pre-trip" selected. If the user selects "Post-trip" in the popup for the inspection, the extension searches for the radio button with the value of "POST_TRIP_DVIC" and clicks it.
    - The extension then searches for the div with the class "css-1geyss9" or the mdn-input-box with the id of "select-68" which is the Driver name field. The extension clicks this field and enters the DA name provided via the popup. An autocomplete list of drivers appears with their transporter IDs. The extension then searches for the driver with the same name as the one entered and makes sure the transporter ID in the list matches that of the selected driver. If a match is found, the driver is selected. If no match is found, the extension clears the field and trys once more. If still no match is found, the user is prompted to select the driver manually.
    - The extension then searches for the div with the class "css-1nbeb1f" which is the inspection date field. The extension clicks this field and enters the inspection date provided via the popup.
    - The extension then searches for the div with the class "css-lwsvuc" which is the inspection time field. The extension clicks this field and enters the inspection time provided via the popup. The time has to be entered with the format HHMMAM or HHMMPM.
    - By default the page has the radio button "Yes" for "Did the inspection identify any defects?" selected. If the user deselected "Vehicle is in satisfactory condition" in the popup and selected vehicle issues, then the extension will do nothing for this step. If the user left the "Vehicle is in satisfactory condition" selected in the popup, then the extension searches for the two radio buttons with the name of "defectsFoundQues" and selects the second one (has value of "false") to indicate "No".
    - The extension then searches for the button with the class "css-c6ayu0" and clicks it, which if the user left "Vehicle is in satisfactory condition" selected in the popup and extension selected the "No" radio, the button will have the text "Next: Review & submit". If the user deselected the "Vehicle is in satisfactory condition" in the popup and provided issues and the extension left the "Yes" radio selected, then the button text will be "Next: Select defects".
    - If the button related to no defects was selected, the extension will wait for the page to change and then search for button with the class "css-c6ayu0" and the text "Submit inspection" and click it.
    - If the button related to vehicle defects found was selected, the extension will wait for the page to change and then search for all divs with the class "css-1lne09z" and click on each of their first child elements as these are all dropdowns for issues and clicking on them expands them to see the issues. The extension will then search for the div or divs with the text that closely or exactly matches that of the issues selected in the popup and clicks on that div to select it. At least one issue must be selected to continue. The extension will then search for button with the class "css-c6ayu0" and the text "Next: Review & submit" and click it. The extension will wait for the page to change and then search for button with the class "css-c6ayu0" and the text "Submit inspection" and click it.
    - Once the inspection has been submitted the popup will close and the user will be shown a success notification message if the user has the "Show notifications after submission" preference enabled in the onboarding/settings page.
